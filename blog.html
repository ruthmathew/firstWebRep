                    <li> <p> Yes it does. this happened becouse 74% of users are more likely to use mobile-friendly websites and people spend 70% of their Internet time on mobile too. As more people gain access to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, it becomes increasingly important to have a site that functions properly for these devices. Mobile responsiveness means that users can access your website from their phone and have the same experience that they would on a desktop.  A key component to a mobile-friendly website is responsive design. Responsive design ensures that your website adapts to whatever device a user uses. And this design is achived by using relative size on styling an element.
