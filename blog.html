            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li> <p> Yes it does. this happened becouse 74% of users are more likely to use mobile-friendly websites and people spend 70% of their Internet time on mobile too. As more people gain access to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, it becomes increasingly important to have a site that functions properly for these devices. Mobile responsiveness means that users can access your website from their phone and have the same experience that they would on a desktop.  A key component to a mobile-friendly website is responsive design. Responsive design ensures that your website adapts to whatever device a user uses. And this design is achived by using relative size on styling an element.

            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li><p> Becouse one can not decide the space his/her website visitors have avaliable, the browser window size is used to determine the size of the website he/she is creating. The fact that very few people browse full screen and majority of the people browse pretty close to full screen makes the 200px browser window size favorable. The browser interprets this size relative to its size.  </p></li>

                    <ul>
                        <h3> Intial Letter</h3>
                        <li> Initial letter is a CSS property that selects the first letter of the element and specifies the number of lines occupied by the letter. It is the property where the first letter of the paragraph is written with much higher size than the rest of the content. This property adjusts both the number of lines needed to create the stylized drop cap and the font size.
                            The ::first-letter pseudo-element can be used to select characters that will be formatted as initial letters with a display value of block, table-cell, table-caption, or list-item.
                            </li>
                        <h3> Variable Font</h3>
                        <li> Variable fonts represent a new set of features where font files are allowed to contain multiple variations of a font in a single file. It allows transitioning font styles, custom font styles, animating and access of the variables contained in the font file. It also gives access to the full range of available styles, weights and widths.</li>
                        <h3> Level 2 Grid</h3>
                        <li> Level 2 of the grid specification creates the subgrid feature of CSS Grid. One can make grids when using the Grid layout option, a grid element can be transformed into a grid container by setting display: grid on it. The development of browser specifications and implementation is a circular process. So one can watch how this subgrid feature is progressing and of emerging browser implementations.</li>
                        <h3> Logical Properties and Values</h3>
                        <li> Logical Properties and Values is a CSS module that controls the appearance through logical directions and dimension mappings. It uses the terms like block and inline to describe the direction in which they flow. The Logical Properties and Values specification characterizes mappings for physical values in their logical relations.</li>
