            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li> <p> Yes it does. this happened becouse 74% of users are more likely to use mobile-friendly websites and people spend 70% of their Internet time on mobile too. As more people gain access to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, it becomes increasingly important to have a site that functions properly for these devices. Mobile responsiveness means that users can access your website from their phone and have the same experience that they would on a desktop.  A key component to a mobile-friendly website is responsive design. Responsive design ensures that your website adapts to whatever device a user uses. And this design is achived by using relative size on styling an element.

            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li><p> Becouse one can not decide the space his/her website visitors have avaliable, the browser window size is used to determine the size of the website he/she is creating. The fact that very few people browse full screen and majority of the people browse pretty close to full screen makes the 200px browser window size favorable. The browser interprets this size relative to its size.  </p></li>
